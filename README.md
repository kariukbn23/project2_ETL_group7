Finding Data
  Your project must use 2 or more sources of data. We recommend the following sites to use as sources of data:

  data.world

  Kaggle


  You can also use APIs or data scraped from the web. However, get approval from your instructor first. Again, there is only a   week to complete this!

Data Cleanup & Analysis
  Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:


  The sources of data that you will extract from.


  The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).


  The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).


  The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.
